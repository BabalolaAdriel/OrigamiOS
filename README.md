## 🧠 How OrigamiOS Works

1. **Input Collection**
   - A hosted `index.html` form allows users to submit their daily task ideas.
   - The input is sent as a JSON POST request to an **n8n webhook**.

2. **Task Storage & Processing**
   - Tasks are stored directly in **Google Sheets** via n8n.
   - A **Cron Trigger Node** retrieves the day's tasks at fixed intervals (every 3 hours).
   - A **Function Node** compiles tasks into an AI-readable prompt.

3. **AI Analysis & Prioritization**
   - The prompt is sent to a hosted model via the **OpenRouter API**.
   - AI returns a clean, ordered schedule with priority tags and actionable insights.

4. **Notification Delivery**
   - AI plans are delivered via:
     - **Telegram Bot** (Origami AI)
     - **Gmail API**
     - **Microsoft Outlook (Graph API)**

5. **Reminders & Routines**
   - Daily spiritual/personal messages (Bible verses, prayer times, motivation) are scheduled via Telegram and email.
